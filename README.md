# Swagger generated server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server

To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

### Generating a new stub server from Swagger

1. Install Swagger Codegen (https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-codegen/)

```sh
# Pre-requisites: Java 7+
brew install swagger-codegen
```

2. Store the latest Swagger spec in a file called `cinode.json` (https://api.cinode.com/docs/index.html)

3. Convert all `operationId` values from `cinode.json` to camelCase. If you don't you will get errors like `Route defined in OpenAPI specification ... but there is no defined onGET operation`:

```sh
# Pre-requisites: Node.js
# Run in the same directory as `swagger.json`
node convertToCamelCase.js
```

4. Generate the server stub:

```sh
swagger-codegen generate -i cinode.json -l nodejs-server -o new-cinode-server-stub
```
